### How to compile?
This library requires the following packages, e.g. installed using `npm`:
* `typescript`
* `jquery` and `@types/jquery`

Then, simply use the provided Makefile commands:
* `make build` compiles Typescript sources to Javascript (in the `build` folder).
* `make clean` removes all built files.
